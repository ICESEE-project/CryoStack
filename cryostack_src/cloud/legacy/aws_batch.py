"""
AWS Batch services for CryoStack.

This module contains AWS-specific execution primitives used by the
CryoStack cloud backend. It intentionally contains no frontend logic.

The functions here provide the cloud equivalents of common HPC
operations such as job status inspection, log retrieval, and job
termination.

    AWS connection configuration.

    Two credential sources are supported, and exactly one is used per call:

    * **developer / operator mode** -- ambient AWS CLI credentials, optionally
      selected by a named ``profile``;
    * **end-user assumed-role mode** -- ``credentials`` carries the temporary
      ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` / ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` / ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``
      from an ``sts:AssumeRole`` call. When present it wins and ``profile`` /
      ambient credentials are never consulted.

    This mirrors :class:`cryostack_src.cloud.drivers.aws.models.AWSConfig`
    exactly -- every caller in this codebase actually passes THAT class's
    instances through here (``AWSDriver.status/logs/terminate`` -> this
    module), never this bare dataclass; it is kept credential-shaped too so
    ``run_aws`` below is correct regardless of which one a caller constructs.
