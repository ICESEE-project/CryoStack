"""
CryoStack generic cloud runtime.

One small runner, one execution descriptor -- the SAME runner for every
supported model; only the ``case "${CRYOSTACK_MODEL}"`` branch differs. The
runner:

1. reads its runtime configuration from the environment
   (``CRYOSTACK_S3_RUN`` / ``CRYOSTACK_MODEL`` / ``CRYOSTACK_RUN_TARGET``),
2. syncs ``<s3-run>/input/`` into a local working directory,
3. runs the model runtime -- exactly what ``stage_example_for_run`` prepared
   (ISSM: injected ``runme.m``, ``cryostack_md_overrides.m``, ``data/<...>``
   datasets, ``postprocess_icesee.m``; Icepack: the selected example's own
   ``.py``/``.ipynb`` run target, then -- if the caller staged one alongside
   the run inputs -- the portable output collector produced by
   :mod:`cryostack_src.models.icepack.postprocess`),
4. syncs ``<workdir>/outputs/`` back to ``<s3-run>/outputs/`` (best effort,
   even on a failed run), and
5. exits with the *true* model exit code.

No scientific logic lives in the runner beyond selecting the per-model runtime
command. No credentials and no MATLAB license value are ever embedded -- the
license, if any, arrives only through the batch container's environment.

**Execution-artifact contract**: this runner script itself becomes the Batch
job definition's ``containerProperties.command`` (:func:`cloud_run_command`),
and AWS Batch resolves/forwards a job's effective container command through
ECS ``RunTask`` overrides on every launch -- capped at 8192 characters,
exactly like ``submit-job``'s own ``--container-overrides``. Any run-specific
or model-specific logic (an output collector, a helper script, ...) that
would make this text large must therefore never be embedded inline here: it
is staged as an ordinary FILE alongside the run's other inputs (via
``WorkspaceManager.stage_example_for_run``'s ``extra_files``, exactly how
ISSM's own ``postprocess_icesee.m`` already works) and simply *invoked* by
filename after ``phase 1`` downloads it -- the runner only ever contains the
short, per-model INVOCATION, never the helper's source text. A run that
predates this convention (or a caller that never staged the helper) is not a
hard failure: the invocation is skipped with a warning, exactly like every
other best-effort step here.
