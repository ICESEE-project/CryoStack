"""
Per-operation credential resolution.

Two explicit, non-mixing paths:

* **BYO-AWS user mode** — the authenticated CryoStack user has a *connected*
  :class:`AWSConnection`. Every operation does a **fresh** ``sts:AssumeRole``
  (nothing from C7.2 is persisted), confirms the returned account matches the
  role ARN *and* the account recorded at connect time, and runs with those
  temporary credentials only. **No profile. No ambient-credential fallback.**
  A broken connection fails closed with :class:`CloudAccessError`.

* **Developer / operator mode** — no connection record exists. Existing
  behaviour: ambient AWS credentials, optionally selected by a named profile.

:func:`resolve_cloud_execution` returns a :class:`CloudExecution` the gateway
threads into ``CloudBridge`` / ``CloudManager`` via the ``credentials`` kwarg
added in C7.1.
