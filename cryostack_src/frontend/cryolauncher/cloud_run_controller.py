# Description :
#     Non-blocking submit + auto-poll + auto-retrieve for an AWS Batch cloud
#     run, on the same asyncio worker/state pattern the auto-tail log worker
#     uses (cryostack_src/workspace/logs.py).

"""CryoStack cloud run controller (C6).

Owns one cloud run's lifecycle so the gateway callback never blocks the Voilà
kernel:

    submit()  -> STAGING -> SUBMITTING -> (job id) -> QUEUED
              -> auto-poll -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED
              -> on COMPLETED: auto-sync outputs -> Results panel refresh

Every AWS call runs in a worker thread (:func:`asyncio.to_thread`); the
controller only touches widget state on the event loop. It converges on the
existing services -- ``CloudBridge`` for submit/status/logs/terminate,
``WorkspaceManager.sync_cloud_results`` for retrieval, the shared
``ResultPackage`` / visualizer for rendering -- and adds no parallel path.

This module holds **no ipywidgets import**: the gateway passes plain callables
(`on_state`, `on_log`, `on_results_ready`) so the controller stays unit
testable with fakes.
