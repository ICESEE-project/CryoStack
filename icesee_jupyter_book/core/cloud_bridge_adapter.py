"""ICESEE Cloud execution adapter over the hardened CryoStack CloudBridge.

Step 1-3 of the staged migration in
``overnight/AUDIT_icesee_cloud_convergence.md``: introduce an adapter over
``CloudBridge`` (step 1), keep ICESEE's existing DA-workload
staging/submission contract behind it via an injected submitter (step 2),
and move status/terminate onto the REAL hardened ``AWSDriver`` lifecycle
(step 3) -- those two operations only need an already-submitted Batch
``job_id`` and never depended on how the job was submitted, so they get
CryoLauncher's own credential handling, error normalization, and
``ExecutionStatus`` shape for free, with zero change to the AWS-side job
definition or container image.

This module does NOT flatten ICESEE into a single-script CryoLauncher run:
the submitter still uploads ``params.yaml`` (the full DA identity --
forecast model, filter, ensemble size, observations, state/parameter
estimation, DA cycle) and the same ``ICESEE_S3_RUN`` / ``ICESEE_EXAMPLE`` /
``ICESEE_RUN_SCRIPT`` env vars the legacy path always has. Only the
lifecycle wrapper (credential handling, result/status normalization,
terminate) is shared with CryoLauncher.

No AWS is ever contacted directly by this module or its tests; every
AWS-touching call flows through an injectable ``aws`` callable all the way
down to :mod:`icesee_jupyter_book.core.cloud_runner`.
